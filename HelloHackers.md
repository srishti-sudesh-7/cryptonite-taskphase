#HELLO HACKERS

##Intro to Commands
in this I learnt how to start the server I need to SSH into and then transferred this server to my terminal by using the command: `ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college`  
after doing this, I just had to type "hello" to get the required flag:
`pwn.college{s5YsO7qZjXdGqeGOGLgD07nzB7p.ddjNyUDLwIzN0czW}`

##Intro to Arguments
argument = the additional data we input along with command
on typing "hello hackers" we get the required flag.
hello - command; hackers - argument.
the flag: `pwn.college{c6njBashUdh2YUnjU-C0n82O-Mv.dhjNyUDLwIzN0czW}`
