# The Root

in order to get the flag, I needed to reach a program called pwn which was in /.   
*note: directories start from / ie it is the root of the filesystem*    
to reach any program, all we need to do is put in its path. so that's what I did.     
since we know that pwn is in /, its path becomes: `/pwn`

on typing /pwn, I got the flag: 
`pwn.college{kTSRHi16X8q0H5NAjsEm1hIrghr.dhzN5QDLwIzN0czW}`
