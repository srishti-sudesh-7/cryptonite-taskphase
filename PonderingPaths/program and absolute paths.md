# Program and Absolute Paths

absolute path: a path that starts from the root directory     

here to get the flag, I needed to reach the program called "run" which was inside the challenge directory, which in turn is inside the root directory /.    
so the path I used is `/challenge/run`

flag: 
`pwn.college{8qKcb4rm02rP1LJbhOy2pwMJIft.dVDN1QDLwIzN0czW}`
